# Basic Specs for Virtual-Machines

- <H1>Hardware</H1>
 When looking into installing a virtual machine, there are a few minimum components you want to make sure you have in order to get the best experience and education from the virtual machine.
 - <b> Basic Hardware Requirements </b>
    -  <b> 500Gb SSD
       -  It is important to have an SSD not an HDD due to overall efficiency, power, and reliability. I personally use a 1Tb SSD
    -  I5 Processor (minimum)
       - I peraonally enjoy an I7
    -  16 Gb of Ram (minimum)
        -  To run it comfortably it is better to have 32Gb or even 64Gb if it is within your budget and you plan on doing a lot of different virtual machines
    - Graphics Card
        - A deditcated graphics card is not neccessary for a machine dedicated for learning different OS's, so do not worry about that unless you also wanted to make it into a gamming/work PC hybrid </b>

 - Overall the minimum requirements will get you by but it may not be the most pleasent of experiences. I recommend getting this very cost effective laptop below if you are just starting out on your IT journey or just want a good point of reference to start looking for your own machine.
